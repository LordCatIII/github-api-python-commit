# github-api-python-commit

A small python script that I made to extend a file on GitHub using the API.

Made using [PyGithub](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub/) so you may need to `pip install pygithub`

There is a [template](/template.py), and an [example](/example.py), which is the code that I use to update my [blabbering section](https://LordCatIII.github.io/blabberings) on my website
